These are some things that I should take care of first,
before attempting to devise any more communication commands.

SERVER:
- Initialize databases
    - Token database
    - User public key database
        - Public key hash
        - List of conversation IDs
    - Online user database (maybe???)
    - Conversation database
        - Primary key: Conversation IDs
        - List of user public key hashes
        - Undelivered messages

DBs all created in SQLite3!

- Add server support for authenticating and registering clients
    - Public-key cryptography (to encrypt challenges)
    - Random challenge generation
    - Challenge signature (response) verification


CLIENT:
- Public-key cryptography:
    - Generate keypair
    - Decrypt and sign challenge
    - JSON parsing support
